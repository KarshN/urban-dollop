        <h1>Scientists mull harmful effects of technological exposure on adolescent brains</h1>

            A growing body of research suggests that excessive exposure to technology may be subtly altering the neural pathways of adolescent brains, according to a controversial new report released Monday by the Institute for Brain Hygiene (IBH).

        <p>
            "The teenage brain is in a crucial developmental phase," says Dr. Harold Pinsley, lead author of the study. "When you expose it to 14 hours of TikTok, video games, and AI chatbots per day, you might as well be throwing a blender in a library."
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Our preliminary scans show what appears to be a literal flattening of the frontal lobe in some subjects," said Dr. Alina Cho, neuroimaging specialist.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The IBH study tracked over 3,000 teens over the span of four years. Results indicated a significant increase in attention fragmentation, digital dependency, and an inexplicable desire to start podcasting.

        <p>
            The researchers were quick to emphasize that the findings are correlational â€” not causal â€” and that more studies are needed. Nonetheless, schools have already begun issuing voluntary "Tech Cleanse Weeks" in which students must go a full 24 hours without touching a screen. One student reportedly began speaking in cursive by day two.

            While some critics have dismissed the findings as alarmist, others argue that the data aligns with observable behavior. "My son hasnâ€™t made eye contact since 2018," said one anonymous parent.
        </p>

        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <p>
            The team at IBH plans to further explore whether certain apps are more neurologically disruptive than others. "So far, it's a toss-up between Clash of Clans and whatever app makes your face look like a potato," said Dr. Pinsley.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether the findings will prompt a shift in parental and educational policy remains to be seen. In the meantime, the report concludes with a simple recommendation: "Maybe just touch grass."
